# Can's dotfiles

Here are the dotfiles I use to manage my terminal experience through various platforms(Linux, macOS, rPi).

## Additional Software

Besides a good a CLI interface, I make use of the following stuff:

- [zsh](http://www.zsh.org)
- [prezto](https://www.github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
- [vim](https://www.vim.org)

## Setup

To setup my dotfiles into your system, just run the script named `setup.sh`. It will ask you your platform and depending on your choice, will populate/copy the necessary files.
